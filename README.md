## Copilot prompts

1. Creating the cannon

    ```text
    I'm building a 2d game in unity and I want to do an angry birds clone. I want to start of with the cannon.

    The cannon should only be able to rotate update and down (W&S) and shoot (space|). The ball/projectile should fall due to gravity. Input should use the InputSystem not the old Input class

    Create the file under Source/Cannon.cs
    ```

1. Creating the projectile and box

    ```text
    Create a box script will be pushed and can topple over easily and destroy after the box has settled after 0.75f seconds
    ```
